# CASscanner
To scan detailed CAS shared via Karvy (https://mfs.kfintech.com/investor/General/ConsolidatedAccountStatement) 
Currently it only scan CAS statement (link to generate above) and creates a workbook, storing fund details in seperate excel sheets.

## A Scanner Again? Why??
It is a make shift attempt to get away from all the insane apps, always needed to share your personal identifiable information with them. No doubt there are many portfolio scanner out there and **all are _better_ than this**.
But I just couldn't stand giving up my data when we can do it on our own. 
Financial Literacy is important and it sucks to see all are using this as a platform to make money while for everything else we got free apps.
Thus after sabbatical of 12 years I picked up coding again, with what i can remember, since i know a bit about excel thus started it in VBA.

Most of you reading this **are smarter** than me and I know first hand there is **no limit of talent** in India.
So use this, in whatever way you find fit. 
      Want to make a better one? Fork this **and just do it**
      Insipired to create your own, **go for it**
      This is lame attempt and you can do it better, I bet you can and you need to show it to the world

And at last all you you can do is to just improve the code here please do, its just me in my free time, trying to re-learn and code (thank god for chatgpt).
And if that is not even possible, share it with anyone who can use excel and want get away from these apps.

A quick user guide is on its way! Link will be updated soon.
